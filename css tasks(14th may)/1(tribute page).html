                <p>Claude Monet, who lived in France from 1840 to 1926,
                     was a founder of Impressionism. He was an innovator and 
                     promoter of the movement's practice of painting outside of 
                     the studio in all weathers, en plein air.

                <p>Few Facts</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <b>1. Impressionism owes its name to him:</b>

                    Monet's 1874 seascape, Impression, Sunrise, 
                    was shown at the first exhibition of the Cooperative and 
                    Anonymous Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers. 
                    The critic Louis Leroy mocked all the unfinished-looking paintings 
                    as 'impressions', and the name stuck.</ul><br>
                <ul>
                    <b></b>2. Monet very nearly drowned:</b>

                    The year before he painted this scene of swimmers at the 
                    popular swimming spot on the Seine known as the Grenouille, 
                    Monet had leapt into the river, intending to take his own life. 
                    He immediately regretted this, but he would be plagued with melancholy 
                    for the rest of his life.</ul><br>

                <ul>

                   <b> 3. He was a refugee:</b>
                    
                    In 1870, as the devastating Franco-Prussian war broke out,
                     Monet and his family escaped Paris to live in London. It was a wise move. 
                     Paris was besieged, and a number of other artists who remained lost their
                      lives in the war, and in the fall of the revolutionary Paris Commune.</ul><br>
                
                <ul>

                    <b>4. Stayin' at the Savoy:</b>
                    
                    Over the years he returned to London, staying in the Savoy Hotel. 
                    From this vantage point on the Thames he painted some of his most striking 
                    abstract works, such as this view of Waterloo Bridge. Today, his favourite rooms, 
                    610 and 611, are named The Monet Suite in his honour.</ul><br>

                <ul>

                    <b>5. He lost his eyesight:</b>
                    
                    From 1914, Monet was severely affected by
                     cataracts which clouded his vision and made it appear yellow. 
                     This was a disaster for the painter, but for many years he was more 
                     afraid of surgery than partial blindness. Eventually, in 1923 he underwent 
                     two operations to remove them.</ul><br>
                
                <ul>
                    <b>6. He was a gardener:</b>

                    By 1890, Monet was selling enough art to be able to buy the house he was
                     renting at Giverny, as well as the surrounding buildings and the land for his gardens. 
                     The gardens would become the focus of both his art and life in his later years - 
                     under his eye they constantly evolved.</ul><br>

                <ul>
                    <b>7. He was a peacemaker:</b>

                    His famous waterflowers at the Mus√©e de l'Orangerie in Paris were donated the 
                    nation to commemorate the end of the First World War. He described his vision of 
                    the exhibition space as, "the illusion of an endless whole, of a wave with no 
                    horizon and no shore."</ul><br>
